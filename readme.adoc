[#introduction]
== Introduction

This is a very basic GitHub Action to simply create a GitHub Pull Request form an existing branch of the given repository to another one. This Action *_does not_* commit any of your changes, nor does it create any of the branches it uses. All this action does is create a Pull Request, nothing more.

NOTE: This Action took inspiration of several other PR creating and updating Actions, however none of them seemed to be doing what I needed, so this exists now.

== Action I/O

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that you lock down the permissions granted to the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` within any workflow you have in your repositories.

This action will need at least these permissions set on the workflow it runs in:

[source,yaml]
----
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
----
